# What is it?

  As in "Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word." - Psalm 119:9

whrwthal is a lightweight and easy to use application, compared to current alternatives. It was inspired by the need for access to rapidly distributable scriptures without fear of persecution in closed-countries. See https://www.opendoorsusa.org/christian-persecution/world-watch-list/, https://flashdrivesforfreedom.org/

As such, whrwthal totals just under 5MB (consider Xiphos-Unix at just under 30MB, Xiphos-Windows 47MB). It can inconspicuously reside on your thumb drive among photos, as well as be sent through email! (Gmail caps its message+attachment size at 25MB)

whrwthal requires no internet connection, and therefore presents no threat to use on your own personal computer, laptop, or even plugged in at a public access computer such as a library. It communicates with no outside program, and requires no additional input beyond initial installation.
