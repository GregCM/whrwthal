## Reporting a Vulnerability
You may reach out directly to <gregcaceres@gmail.com> to report a security vulnerability.
I also encourage you to submit a detailed issue so that I can assign it, work on it, and direct others to that issue should I need help.
If the vulnerability is a matter of whrwthal's security measures, and if it's within my power to fix it, I will as my first priority.
If the vulnerability is a matter of your hardware or other software on your system, I ask that you do everything that you can to harden
your system on your own. I can offer advice, but writing code for whrwthal to rectify problems that are actually caused by some other program
or cause is not effective, efficient, or realistic. Those kinds of issues will recieve a won't-fix tag. I'll keep the issue open as long as
it's relevant, so that it's available to anyone who may actually have a solution to the problem outside of modifying whrwthal.

Please feel free to reach out. If you want to use whrwthal but can't because of security concerns, I will work on nothing but your issue until I fix it.
You'll recieve an update on my progress anytime I do a significant commit, or fix the issue. If the issue takes particularly long, I'll update you at
least biweekly, even if I haven't made any progress. When you report the vulnerability, let me know if there are any special precautions I should take
in updating or contacting you.
